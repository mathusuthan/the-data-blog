I am an experienced full-stack Data Scientist. I have implemented end to end Machine Learning pipelines on-premise and on cloud for problems in various domains - Banking, Logistics, Pharma and Retail. I am an autodidact, avid Kaggler and a bookworm. In my free time I love to read books, and peruse University Courses and MOOCs.
