Inspired by some of the #100days challenges on the web, I started this  'blogathon' on things I have learned and am learning about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and related topics.

I thought this would be a nice way to finally kick-off 2020. I hope you would find some of these posts and projects useful. If you want to talk to me on anything related to Data Science or Machine Learning Engineering, please feel free to contact me. Cheers !!
