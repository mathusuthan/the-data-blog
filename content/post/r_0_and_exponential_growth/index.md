In these unfortunate times of the pandemic, one might have come across the [R<sub>0</sub> number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number) to indicate how contagious the COVID-19 disease is. Let us see in this post why the R<sub>0</sub> number known as the basic reproduction number matters.

The wikipedia definition puts it nicely - "_the R0 of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection_" . Let us breakdown this and try to understand why the COVID-19 disease is so dangerous. There are two main points here:

1. The expected number of infected cases directly generated by one case.
2. What happens to the cases infected without any intervention (_when every individual is susceptible to infection_) and with intervention (_via isolation measures or vaccination_)

## The expected number of cases starting with one individual

Let us start with the simplest case - when R0 is 1. That is one individual can infect one person.
