In the [previous post](../exploratory_analysis), we looked at two plots for understanding numeric data. In this post, we look at bar charts and contingency tables for single and multiple variables. Then we look at plots for relationships between various data - scatter plots and line plots. Finally, we look at facets that help us view multiple related plots simultaneously.
