This repo contains some simple Deep Learning models I built to teach my team Deep Learning.

The initial code was from the [repo](https://github.com/lukas/ml-class). I have modified the TensorFlow code to fit my coding style and added PyTorch code as well.

I have recently started translating the code to [Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku)  which is a neural network library for [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

You can find the code at my GitHub [repo](https://github.com/mathusuthan/gently-dl).
